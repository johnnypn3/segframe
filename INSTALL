Installation intructions:

Dependencies:

minFunc:
The optimization steps uses the minFunc optimizer, see http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/minFunc.html. 
Please download the minFunc_2012.zip archive, unzip it to the 'thirdparty' directory, i.e. 'thirdparty/minFunc_2012', and compile (e.g., run
'matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r "mexAll; exit;"')

HistDist and LOI:
The image similarity and interpolation parts is performed by the LOI code
by Sune Darkner (darkner@diku.dk). Please download the file LOI.zip from
http://image.diku.dk/darkner/LOI and unzip the files into the 'thirdparty'
directory. Currently, the 2D spline interpolation and 2D image similarity code
is not included in the LOI.zip file. This should be correctly shortly but
please contact Sune for the files until then.

sla:
Clone it from 'https://github.com/nefan/sla' into the 'thirdparty' directory.

OMP:
The native workers for LDDMM are parallellized using OMP. The package is tested
using libgomp, i.e. 'apt-get install libgomp1' on Ubuntu.

Documentation:
The documentation can be generated using the m2html
(http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/) package. You may also want the graphviz package ('apt-get install graphviz' on Ubuntu).

Installation:
Edit the file common.mk to contain the correct paths to the dependency libraries. Then run 'make'.
Documentation is generated using the m2html by running 'make doc'.
